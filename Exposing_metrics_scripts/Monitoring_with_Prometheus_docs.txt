Monitoring User and Application Metrics using Prometheus
Introduction
This document describes how to monitor user and application metrics using Prometheus in Python. The script leverages the `prometheus_client` library to expose metrics such as the number of users in the system and the active and previously used applications.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
1. Python 3.x
2. Prometheus
3. The `prometheus_client`, `win32com.client`, `pygetwindow`, and `getpass` Python packages
Installation
1. Install Python packages:
pip install prometheus_client pywin32 pygetwindow
2. Download and set up Prometheus from the official website.
How to Use
1. Run the Python script.
2. Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8001` to see the metrics.
3. Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from this endpoint.
4. You can visualize these metrics using Grafana or the Prometheus UI.
